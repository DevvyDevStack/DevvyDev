## Security Considerations

This is a static portfolio website with the following security considerations:

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
Consider implementing CSP headers on your hosting platform:
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' fonts.googleapis.com; font-src fonts.gstatic.com; script-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:;
```

### HTTPS
Always serve the website over HTTPS to ensure:
- Data integrity
- User privacy
- Search engine optimization

### Third-Party Dependencies
The website uses minimal third-party resources:
- Google Fonts (fonts.googleapis.com, fonts.gstatic.com)

### Form Security
The contact form includes:
- Client-side validation
- XSS prevention through proper encoding
- No direct server interaction (implementation dependent)

## Security Best Practices

When hosting this website:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always serve over secure connections
2. **Update Hosting Platform**: Keep your hosting platform updated
3. **Monitor Access Logs**: Watch for unusual activity
4. **Backup Regularly**: Maintain current backups
5. **Implement CSP**: Use Content Security Policy headers
6. **Form Handling**: Implement proper server-side validation if using forms

## Deployment Security

### GitHub Pages
If using GitHub Pages:
- Repository should be public for GitHub Pages
- Ensure no sensitive data in commit history
- Use environment variables for any configuration

### Custom Hosting
If using custom hosting:
- Keep server software updated
- Use proper file permissions
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor server logs

## Code Security

The codebase follows security best practices:

### JavaScript
- No `eval()` usage
- Proper event handling
- XSS prevention in dynamic content
- Input validation and sanitization

### CSS
- No external CSS imports from untrusted sources
- Inline styles avoided where possible

### HTML
